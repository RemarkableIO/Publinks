# Publinks!

Publinks is a simple and safe implementation of the publish-subscribe pattern in Swift.

# Example

Publinks can be used anywhere for broadcasting a value or optional value to a set of subscribers. You can find some example `Publinks-Example.playground`. Please note that you must open the playground from within the Xcode project and build both the module and `Publinks-Example` targets for the playground.
